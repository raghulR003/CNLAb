AIM:
To simulate a LAN based on Ethernet with a min of 10 nodes and examine the performance under different load scenarios.

PROCEDURE:
    1. Create a new project - Open Riverbed, Select Project, New Project (name: project_Ethernet), scenario: Coax_2
       Span LANs to a few thousand metres
       Startup Wizard: Empty scenario, Office in Network Scale list, X=200 Y=100
       Finish

    2. Topology -> Rapid Configuration -> Select Bus -> Select next
       Inside the Rapid Configuration module:
        1. Select models - ethcoax
        2. Return to the module - Now Select
            Node model - ethcoax_station
            Link model - eth_coax
            Number - 5
            Tap Model - eth_tap
            Head of bus: X - 20, Y - 50
            Size: X - 170, Y - 20
        3. Finish up

    3. Now to configure the coaxial cable
        1. Right click on the horizontal link -> Select Edit Attributes. The attributes module will open up
        2. Select model name (eth_coax), right click and select 'Edit'.
        3. In the choose bus link model - Choose eth_coax_adv from eth_coax_adv.
        4. Now select advanced to view the entire list of configurations for the bus.
        5. Now, change these attributes: thickness to 5, delay to 0.05

        Click ok, now the coaxial cable should have thickened, now save the project

    4. Now to configure the nodes
        1. Click on any node, then select 'Select similar nodes', then select 'Edit Attributes'
        2. Expand Traffic Generation Parameters - Now change ON time to exponential(100), OFF time to exponential(0.00001)
        3. Now expand Packet Generation Arguments - Change Interarrival time to exponential(2) and Packet Size to constant(1024)
        4. Make sure "Apply to selected objects" is selected, then click Ok.
    
    5. Now to choose the statistics
        1. Right click on project space, click 'Individual DES statistics' then expand 'Global Statistics'
        2. Expand 'Traffic Sink', then select 'Traffic Received (packets/sec)'.
        3. Expand 'Traffic Source', then select 'Traffic Sent (packets/sec)'.

    6. Now to choose average of those statistics as a scalar value
        1. From DES -> Choose Statistics(Advanced). Traffic sent and received should appear outward.
        2. Right click on sent(or received), then set scalar data to 'enabled' and type attribute to 'time average'
        3. Click on 'save' and return to window, then again 'save'.

    7. Now to run the simulation
        1. Click on the dude running symbol (Run), and then select 30 seconds in Duration. Run the simulation (Now exp(2) time sim has been finished)
        2. After it finishes, save the file, and now select scenarios -> duplicate scenarios.
        3. For the scenarios named aptly to Interarrival times as exponentials: 0.025,0.03,0.035,0.05,0.1,0.25,0.5,1, change the appropriate nodes by selecting
           "Select similar nodes" then change the Interarrival time to exp(as such).
        4. Make sure to save everytime.

    8. View the Results:
        1. Right click on Project Space -> View Results
        2. Go to DES Parametric Studies
        3. From Results -> Results for Current Project
        4. Uncheck 'Include vectors'
        5. Uncheck 'coax_0-025'
        6. Expand Scalar Statistics -> Traffic Sink -> Traffic Received as Set to Y axis
           Traffic Source -> Traffic Sent as Set to X axis
        7. You'll be getting a linear graph. That's it.
