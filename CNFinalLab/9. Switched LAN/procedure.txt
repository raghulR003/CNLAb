1. New -> Project Name: project_SwitchedLAN and type: OnlyHub. Finish the module setup. Close the object module.

2. Rapid Configuration -> Star -> Select models: ethernet and click ok.
    1. Center model name: ethernet16_hub and Periphery Node model: ethernet_station
    2. Link model: 10BaseT
    3. Number=16
    4. X=Y=50 and Radius=42

    Click ok.

3. Configure the nodes
    1. Select a node, and click 'Select similar nodes'
    2. Expand Traffic Generation Parameters
        ON state time - exp(100)
        OFF state time - exp(0.00001)
        Packet Generation Arguments:
            Interarrival time - exp(0.02)
    3. Save everything

4. Choose Statistics:
    1. Right click on project workspace -> Click Choose Individual DES statistics
    2. Choose from Ethernet: Delay, Traffic Sink: Traffic Received, Traffic Source: Traffic Sent,Node Statistics -> Ethernet: Collision Count
    3. Save the file

5. Run the simulation:
    1. Click the running dude
    2. Set to 2 minutes
    3. Run the simulation, and save the file.

Until now, only a simuation that connects 16 stations to a single hub is done. We need to use a switch next.

6. Duplicate the scenario.
7. Open object palatte -> Select and place: ethernet16_hub and ethernet16_switch (already one hub is present)
8. Delete all links, then place the switch->hub->switch in the middle of the stations, then create new connections using 10BaseT link from Object palatte.
9. Save the file.

10. Run the simulation (the same 2 minutes)

11. Now to view the results:
    1. DES -> Results -> Compare Results
    2. In Presentation, change from 'As Is' to 'time_average'
    3. Results for: Current Project and then select OnlyHub and OnlyHub1 (it should be HubAndSwitch tho) 
    4. Expand everything in Global Statistics. Also, expand in Object Statistics -> Office Network -> Hub 1 -> Ethernet
    5. Select Traffic Sent alone now. A graph shows up (the traffic sent in both scenarios is almost identical)
    6. Unselect Sent and select Received now. A graph shows up, where the traffic received with the second scenario, HubAndSwitch, is higher than that of the OnlyHub scenario.
    7. Click the delay next. Unselect and select everything now to see a 4-coloured graph.

Colour colour aah paakurathu thaa matter uh. Bye bye.
